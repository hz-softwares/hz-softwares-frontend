				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>
					Hello! My name is Hady Elzayady, and I am a passionate software engineer with a strong background in
					full-stack development, systems engineering, and cutting-edge technologies. With expertise in React, Node.js,
					Rust, and Kubernetes, I enjoy creating scalable, high-performance applications and tackling challenging
					architectural problems. I'm particularly interested in distributed systems, cloud computing, and
					micro-services, and I'm always exploring innovative tools like Bun.js, Biome.js, and Drizzle to enhance my
					workflows. When I'm not coding, I love diving into open-source contributions, building tools to boost
					productivity, and continuously learning to advance my career. Letâ€™s connect and create something impactful!
